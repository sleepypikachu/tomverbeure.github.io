# Potential Feature Set

* Output dejittered PPS
* Multiple OXCO support to compare
* DAC control + PWM control to compare
* Microcontroller control
* Various temperature sensors on OCXO, inside enclosure, outside temp

Different approaches: 

FLL

* Measure number of pulses between PPS pulses.
* Average...
* Adjust control voltage
* Benefit: 
	* works where there's a large frequency difference between
	  reference and output
	* should have a much lower time constant?
* Disadvantage: 
	* slippage doesn't get corrected later on.
* [How a Frequency Locked Loop (FLL) Works](https://wirelesspi.com/how-a-frequency-locked-loop-fll-works/)
	* CFO: carrier frequency offset
	* article not really relevant?
* PLL lock implies FLL lock, but not the opposite.
	* frequency is the time derivative of phase

	    When phase goes up at a steady rate, the frequency is constant.

* edn: [Frequency and Phase Locked Loops](https://www.edn.com/frequency-and-phase-locked-loops-pll/)
	* Patent of some logic that has both frequency and phase detector
* esa: [Frequency Lock Loop (FLL)](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/Frequency_Lock_Loop_(FLL))
* https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00255726v2/document: 
  *Note that the stability of the PLL is also usually much more difficult to obtain than with an FLL. 
   This is due to the “integrator” that naturally appears in the PLL structure.*

PLL

* [PLL - why compare phases not frequencies](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/34587/pll-why-compare-phases-not-frequencies)

    > Equivalently, phase is the time integral of frequency. So, when a phase detector is 
    > used to control frequency via a VCO, there is an integration around the loop. 
    > Or, roughly speaking, a low-pass filtering effect.

	A VCO counts as an integrator.

	Comment by Allan Herriman describes AUDIO_clkgen.

* PLL with XOR or 4046 phase detector
    * Divide down pulse output from GPS to make 50% duty cycle
    * Divide down 10MHz similarly
    * If only PPS available, then forced to always use a very high
      time constant.
    * ublox can have output that is a multiple of its internal 48MHz clock

* PLL with a TIC (Time Interval Converter)
    * Measure time from PPS to the next edge of the divided down 10MHz clock

    Uses [Si5328 Synchronous Ethernet Jitter-Attenuating Clock Multiplier](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/368/Si5328-1397980.pdf)
    to create clocks between 450Hz and 800MHz.

    * [Eevblog teardown discussion](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/metrology/leo-bodnar-mini-precision-gps-reference-clock-teardown/)
        * Lots of interesting information, comparisons with other GPSDO etc.
    * Has 2 clock outputs (programmable frequency), but both outputs are derived from a common VCO.
    * Uses u-blox M8 module
    * Supposedly very low phase noise.
        * Much lower phase noise than a BG7TBL GPSDO.
    * The PCB has a cutout around TCXO (see teardown.) According to Leo this reduces the rate of frequency change and makes it easier
      to follow the drift.

**Various builds - Traditional Analog PLL**

* [Probably the Simplest GPS Disciplined Oscillator possible](https://www.sdradio.eu/g4jnt/gpsdo.html)

    * Starts with an explanation about jitter on 1pps signals and long averaging times/time constants.
      And because of that, the oscillator needs to be stable for the duration of this time constant as well.
    * Uses a Jupiter-T module with 10kHz output.
        * Decent quality. No major detectable components in the
          sub Hz range.
    * Because of relatively high but stable 10kHz signal, can use a very simple traditional analog PLL
      with time constant of a few tens of seconds.
    * Uses a cheap VTCXO with 5MHz output.
    * Very bare bones without any way to read NMEA,  no good lock indication, no microcontroller, etc.
    * Some test results with [Argo - a DFCW and QRSS viewer](http://www.weaksignals.com/)
    * Not super stable: varies by a few Hz and wanders around the mean over a period of ~30 seconds.
        * Expected given the time constant.

* [Simple GPS Stabilised 10 MHz Oscillator](http://jrmiller.online/projects/ministd/frqstd0.htm)

    * PDF file... in German. Detailed description.

    * 74HC7046A phase comparator, standard RC LPF to control OCXO input.
    * Multiple output fanout board
    * Uses generic VC-OCXO: Bliley NV47, ENE 3311B, CTI OSC5A2B02

    * Uses a TIC: time-interval converter with ~1ns accuracy 
	* Fine grain is done with HC390 divider and 4046 to create a pulse that goes into an RC
	  to create analog. ADC of Arduino is used to read out.
	* Coarse grain is done by Arduino timer.
    * Uses PLL, implemented with an Arduino.
    * 16-bit DAC built with 2 8-bit PWM counters.
    * TIC and DAC capacitors need to be temperature stable type.

    * Excellent description, goes into a lot of detail to identify cause of inaccuracies.
    * Spends a lot of time and effort on temperature regulation.
    * Talks about different ublox modules.
    * Compares different OCXOs.
    * Schematic uses 'miti squarer' that converts sine way for square wave with coil and caps???

* [A SIMPLE GPS DISCIPLINED REFERENCE](https://www.qsl.net/zl1bpu/MICRO/SIMPLE/SimpleGPS.htm)

    * Uses an ATTINY to operate everything.
    * Clock of ATTINY is the 10MHz OSC clock itself: goes into the XTAL input.
    * 1pps input also goes straight into the ATTINY.
    * Everyting is done in software, with interrupts and overflow counters.
    * Has real RS232 for telemetry info.
    * RAKON OCXO (obsolete)

*  [Yet Another DIY GPSDO](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/yet-another-diy-gpsdo-yes-another-one/)

    * Initially implemented an FLL, but also has a PLL option.

    * UBX-TIM-TP message from GPS receiver can be used to compensate for PPS quantization.
      Reduces RMS from 30ns on 16ns.
    * Use LEA-6T module ("timing module")

* One thing to explore: use that PLL to convert from 10MHz to 800MHz and use that for counting?

    That PLL has very low phase noise.

# Calculations:

* [Timing and Location Performance of Recent u-blox GNSS Receiver Modules](https://hamsci.org/sites/default/files/publications/2020_TAPR_DCC/N8UR_GPS_Evaluation_August2020.pdf)

    * Section 7: with sawtooth correction, a ZED-F9T is 3 orderds of magnitude better than a bad GPS.

* Ublox M8N jitter: 
    * 1pps
    * peak-to-peak phase variation 17ns (figure 7 above)

* M8T: 
    * Still single frequency
    * Provide raw observation data for RTK or PPP processing.
    * Provide quantization error correction.
    * Provide 0D or timing solution
    * 2 TIMEPULSE outputs + 2 EXTINT inputs
    * Peak to peak phase variation: ? (Not mentioned.)

* F9T
    * Double frequency
    * peak-to-peak phase variation 7ns 

* LEA-M8F: 
    * ~a GPSDO with internal TCXO.
    * "jitter-free" pps.
    * results not as good as a traditional GPSDO.

* Quantization error correction improves things by ~1 order of magnitude.

* Timing/0D mode improves things somewhat.

* Averaging PPS:
    * 17ns -> 17E-9
    * Sample with 10MHz clock? -> 100ns accuracy only
    * Simple counter: capture rising edge, reset to 0. No dead time.
    * 100ns
    * Real value-> Tclock/2/sqrt(N)
    * For example: 100ns/2/sqrt(1000)=1.5ns or 1.5E-9
    * If pure analog: 17ns/2/sqrt(1000)=2.7E-10
    * So, after 1000 samples (1000 seconds), you have a 1pps signal with 2.7E-10 accuracy.
    * For comparision: if 10kHz clock, also 17ns phase difference.
        * After 1000 seconds -> 10000000 samples.
        * 17ns/2/sqrt(10000000)=2.7E-12 measurement accuracy.
        * If we multiply by 10000->2.7E-8
